                  - Google CloudVision * it also has image finders capabilities for search and lookup options
                  - GoodReadsAPi
                  - Instagram Hashtags (kind of make my own API if Instagram is too $$)

            - What data you’re planning to store in your database:
                  - Book Title, Author, Bookshelves created by User, Images, ratings
            
            - Anything else about the project you’d like your advisor to know or would like their feedback on:
                  - I'm probably going to store images and files in an S3 bucket and want to have a really cool UI
