        "description": "An extraordinary look at an ordinary day\u2014June 16, 1904\u2014in the life of a middle-aged Jewish man living in Dublin, Ireland. Leopold Bloom, who is sure that his wife is being unfaithful, must come to terms with how that affects their marriage and whether it changes the nature of their love for one another. Richly detailed stream-of-consciousness narration immerses the reader in the thoughts and emotions of the characters as they deal with the normal events of daily life in Dublin, as well as grander issues like sexuality, prejudice, birth, and death. This is an unabridged version of Irish author James Joyce's groundbreaking modernist tale, which parallels Homer's Odyssey. It was first published serially in the American journal The Little Review between 1918 and 1921, and published in novel form in 1922 in Paris.",

For me, the novel is a comment on the values and cynicism of east coast America almost a hundred years ago, a time when a section of society had suddenly become very wealthy and the American Dream was for most, nothing more than the mere pursuit of money.\u2019 Peter Joucla \u2018Peter Joucla\u2019s surprisingly clear-eyed adaptation cuts to the heart of Fitzgerald\u2019s text while preserving a very decent amount of it.\u2019 4 stars \u2013Evening Standard \u2018Evoking all the glamour and atmosphere of the roaring twenties, Wilton\u2019s brings Gatsby to glorious, all-singing, all-dancing life (jazz hands optional).

Winston Smith rewrites history for the Ministry of Truth, but when he\u2019s handed a note that says simply \u2018I love you\u2019 by a woman he hardly knows, he decides to risk everything in a search for the real truth. In a world where cheap entertainment keeps the proles ignorant but content, where a war without end is always fought and the government is always watching, can Winston possibly hold onto what he feels inside? Or will he renounce everything, accept the Party\u2019s reality and learn to love Big Brother? \u2018Dunster \u2013 both in his faithful take on the story and in his sometimes extreme but always enthralling adaptation \u2013 gets close to the heart of Orwell\u2019s warning, pointing up but not overemphasising its current political resonances.... Newspeak, Doublethink, Room 101 and Thought Police take on a chilling reality in this compelling production.\u2019 \u2013 The Independent",

        "description": "'Love...it means too much to me, far more than you can understand.' Anna Karenina is a beautiful and intelligent woman, whose passionate love for a handsome officer sweeps aside all other ties - to her marriage and to the network of relationships and moral values that bind the society around her. Her love affair with Vronsky is played out alongside the developing romance between Kitty and Levin, and in the character of Levin, closely based on Tolstoy himself, the search for happiness takes on a deeper philosophical significance. One of the greatest novels ever written, Anna Karenina combines penetrating psychological insight with an encyclopedic depiction of Russian life in the 1870s. From high society St Petersburg to the threshing fields on Levin's estate, the novel's intricate labyrinth of connections is deeply involving. Rosamund Bartlett's new translation conveys Tolstoy's precision of meaning and emotional accuracy in an English version that is vivid, nuanced, and compelling. ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

        "description": "The Iliad is the story of a few days' fighting in the tenth year of the legendary war between the Greeks and the Trojans, which broke out when Paris, son of King Priam of Troy, abducted the fabulously beautiful Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. After a quarrel between the Greek commander, Agamemnon, and the greatest of the Greek warriors, Achilles, the gods become more closely involved in the action. Their intervention leads to the tragic death of Hector, the Trojan leader, and to the final defeat of the Trojans. But the Iliad is much more than a series of battle scenes. It is a work of extraordinary pathos and profundity that concerns itself with issues as fundamental as the meaning of life and death. Even the heroic ethic itself - with its emphasis on pride, honour, prowess in battle, and submission to the inexorable will of the gods - is not left unquestioned.",

        "description": "Heart of Darkness is a short novel by Polish novelist Joseph Conrad, written as a frame narrative, about Charles Marlow's life as an ivory transporter down the Congo River in Central Africa. The river is \"a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land.\" In the course of his travel in central Africa, Marlow becomes obsessed with Mr. Kurtz. The story is a complex exploration of the attitudes people hold on what constitutes a barbarian versus a civilized society and the attitudes on colonialism and racism that were part and parcel of European imperialism. Originally published as a three-part serial story, in Blackwood's Magazine, the novella Heart of Darkness has been variously published and translated into many languages. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Heart of Darkness one of the hundred best novels in English of the twentieth century.",
